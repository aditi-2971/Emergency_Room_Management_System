# Emergency_Room_Management_System
<br>
Developed a Room Management System for emergency rooms, enabling administrators to add patients, view ER status, and prioritize cases. Doctors log in to treat the next patient and check ER status. General users can access real-time ER updates.

<strong>>Brief Description</strong
<br>
The Emergency Room Management System is like a computer program written in Java that helps hospitals organise their emergency rooms better. In emergencies, it’s important to quickly figure out which patients need help the most. The system uses a special way of organising patients called “Priority Queue” to make sure doctors can focus on the most urgent cases first. It’s like having a smart system to decide who gets help first when a lot of people need it.
